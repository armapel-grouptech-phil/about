                <h3>November 2024</h3>
                <p>The company was founded with the launch of its initial product, <strong>lingk IPTV</strong>. This service provided users with an M3U link hosted on GitHub, aggregating television channels from the Philippines and a selection of global channels from IPTV-org/IPTV. The M3U link was designed for use with third-party IPTV player applications on various devices, including televisions, laptops, and mobile phones.</p>

                <h3>December 2024</h3>
                <p>Service for the M3U link was suspended at the end of the month. This decision was made after a key channel from the Philippines became unavailable and a technical resolution could not be readily identified.</p>

                <div class="service-item">
                <h3>February 2025</h3>

                <p><strong>FlowNews</strong> was discontinued on May 20 due to persistent server-side technical issues. Subsequently, the partnership with TMDB for Flow+ was terminated due to financial constraints, leading to the removal of the trending shows and movies feature. The Flow+ website was then taken offline.</p>
